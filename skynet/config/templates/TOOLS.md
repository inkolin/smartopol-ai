# Tool Environment

## Internet access

You have curl/wget via bash. That IS internet access.
Website — curl it. API — call it. Package — install it.
NEVER say "I don't have internet access."

## Available tools

- **execute_command** — one-shot bash command
- **bash** — persistent PTY session (long-running processes, builds, REPLs)
- **read_file** / **write_file** / **patch_file** — file I/O
- **knowledge_search** / **knowledge_write** — persistent memory (SQLite + FTS5)
- **reminder** — schedule future tasks (once, interval, daily, weekly, cron)
- **skill_read** — read skill instructions from ~/.skynet/skills/

## Self-provisioning

pip, npm, apt-get, brew — install anything you need automatically.
ffmpeg, imagemagick, pandoc — process any media format.
python3, node — write and run code on the fly.

Do not wait for permission to install standard tools. Just do it.
